## Project Overview

This project is a Java-based digital board/card game inspired by Minoan archaeology. The game simulates archaeological exploration and discovery, where two players compete by moving pawns, collecting cards, and uncovering rare findings on a virtual board representing Minoan sites such as Knossos, Malia, Phaistos, and Zakros.

### Key Features

- **MVC Architecture:** The project is structured using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for clear separation of concerns.
- **Graphical User Interface:** The game features a Swing-based GUI for interactive play.
- **Game Logic:** Includes classes for cards, findings, pawns, players, and the game table, each representing different aspects of the game.
- **Assets:** Uses custom images and sounds to enhance the gaming experience.
- **Testing:** Contains JUnit tests for core game logic.
- **Javadoc Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation is available in the `javadoc_output` directory.

### How to Run

- To start the game, run the `MVC.java` file, which initializes the game window.
- To run tests, execute `JUnitTests.java`.
- For Javadoc, custom tags are used: `-tag Precondition` and `-tag Postcondition`.
